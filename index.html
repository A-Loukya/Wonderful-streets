        <p class="sectionSubTAg text-small">Colorful painted houses with a canal in the middle is exactly what makes the street of Burano a dreamy place to live in. If you’ve had your fascination with the pictures of Venice for a long time, there are chances that most of them were clicked in Burano. Though the idea behind painting the houses there was not to make the street look vibrant, but to distinguish one’s home from another’s. But, if the result turned out to be this beautiful, who cares?Although the island soon became a thriving settlement, it was administered from Torcello and had none of the privileges of that island or of Murano. It rose in importance only in the 16th century, when women on the island began making lace with needles, being introduced to such a trade via Venetian-ruled Cyprus.

        <p class="sectionSubTAg text-small">The city was founded in 1471 as a small kasbah (fortress) by Moulay Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a descendant of Abd as-Salam al-Alami and Idris I, and through them, of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Along with the Ghomara tribes of the region, many Moriscos and Jews settled here after the Spanish Reconquista in medieval times. After eight years of the creation of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco the Spanish Army could effectively take Chaouen, when General Dámaso Berenguer occupied the city on 14 October 1920.        
            In September 1925, in the middle of the Rif War, a rogue squadron of American volunteer pilots, including veterans of World War I, bombarded civilians in Chaouen. Colonel Charles Sweeney had proposed the idea to French Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, who "warmly welcomed the Colonel's request."

        <p class="sectionSubTAg text-small">It is springtime and Pretorian by-lanes experience jewel-toned blooms in full force, drawing thousands of visitors to the country
            Whenever Pretoria-based Karabo Makwetla steps out between September and January, he is met with an explosion of purple, courtesy of Jacaranda trees in full bloom.
            
            A radio jockey for North West University’s Mahikeng campus station NWU FM 105.5, Makwetla is no stranger to these trees. When Spring beckons, the thousands of Jacaranda trees that dot Pretorian avenues (Pretoria is nicknamed Jacaranda City) help the city turn over a new colour. Without a doubt, then, Makwetla thoroughly enjoys the first summer rainfall in October; it is also his “favourite time of the year”.Pretoria’s purple canopy also draws thousands of visitors to South Africa.

        <p class="sectionSubTAg text-small">The tradition of celebrating the blooming of cherry blossom trees is centuries old in Japan. The flowering of the cherry tree, also known as “Sakura”, has a rich meaning in the Japanese culture. It used to signal to farmers that spring is near and that it was time to plant their crops.

            Today the cherry blossom flowers are a symbol of hope, beauty, and new life. The planting of cherry blossom trees in Bonn originated in 1980 as a symbol of friendship to Germany from the people of Japan.
            
            What makes the Cherry Blossom Ave in Bonn so special is that this avenue is ONLY lined with Sakura trees. This creates a vivid pink tunnel for the whole block every March into April.

        <p class="sectionSubTAg text-small">The old town of Brienz in Switzerland has homes that are partly made of wood, and partly with brick. But what adds charm to their overall beauty are the coloured foliages and flowers planted right on the outside of the homes, and at the edge of their balconies, which make them look like a picture from an old storybook.The first settlements date from the neolithic and Bronze Ages. In the 5th century BC, the Celts settled in the alpine valleys among the sources of the Rhone, the Rhine and the Danube, eventually stretching from the headwaters down to Vienna and Belgrade. At the end of 1st century BC the Romans conquered this area. The Roman settlements were destroyed by the Alamanni in 259/60. They eventually settled in the area around 450. In any case, evidence has been found for a settlement by the Alamanni in the 7th century. Brienz is first mentioned in 1146 as Briens. In 1528, after an eventful history, Brienz became part of the Canton of Bern.
